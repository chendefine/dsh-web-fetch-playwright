## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- First public release as a DSH bundle plugin.
- `PlaywrightFetchProvider` registered with `ctx.web` under id `playwright`; the bundle patch pins the web seam's `fetchProvider` to it and enables the `web_fetch` tool with a 60s budget.
- Local backend: path / `$PATH` / bundled `playwright-core` resolution with native-executable sniffing and package-root discovery.
- Remote backend: CDP connect (`connectOverCDP`) with fresh isolated context per fetch.
- Denoise pipeline: jsdom → Mozilla Readability → DOMPurify (layout tags dropped, `KEEP_CONTENT: false`) → Turndown + GFM with `tool-web`-consistent style and table rules.
- Per-fetch deadline (45s), concurrent-fetch semaphore (2), resource-subrequest filtering, 100k body cap, `WEB_*` error taxonomy parity with the shipped HTTP provider.
- Client settings card (*Playwright 网页爬取*) with backend radio, nested path/CDP inputs, denoise checkbox, and zh/en locales.
- Unit tests (config, markdown, playwright resolution, provider over a fake browser) plus a self-skipping real-browser integration smoke.
